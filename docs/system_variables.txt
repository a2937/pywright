Special variables:


Music
-----
Related commands: mus

'_music_loop'
    Music can be made to play an intro track and then loop a different
track. When music is played with the 'mus' command, the looping variable
is set to the track that was played. If you then set the looping variable
to a different track, once the current track finishes it will loop the one that
was set. 

'_music_fade'
    The volume level of music can be adjusted by changing this variable.
Valid levels are from '0' which means music can't be heard, to 100 which
is full volume. The variable has an effect even if changed while music is
playing. Note that the volume a player hears is also affected by their
music volume setting.


Saved Games
-------------
Related commands: savegame, loadgame

    You can disallow the player from saving or loading the game with
'set _allow_saveload off'. The menus will no longer come up when the
player hits the hotkeys. If your wrightscript calls the savegame or
loadgame functions which fire off a direct save or load action, the
value of _allow_saveload will not be referenced (savegame will
always work).

    You can also 'set _allow_autosave off' to turn the autosave function
off during the game. If you have a section in your game where you
do not want the player to save, you should turn both of these
variables off.

    Be VERY careful to remember to turn them back on again, or
players will no longer be able to save!
